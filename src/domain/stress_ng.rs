//! Stress-ng Domain Entity
//!
//! This module provides a domain entity for stress-ng, a tool for stress testing
//! CPU and memory on Linux and macOS systems.

/// This struct is used to configure and manage the parameters for a stress-ng test.
/// It includes settings for CPU load, memory load, test duration, and other options.

    /// to specific needs or conditions.

    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `cpu_load` - CPU load percentage.
    /// * `memory_load` - Memory load in megabytes.
    /// * `timeout` - Duration of the test in seconds.
    /// * `aggressive` - Enable more aggressive test options.
    /// * `keep_name` - Keep process names unchanged.
    /// * `log_brief` - Simplify log output format.
    /// * `taskset` - Set specific CPU affinity for the test.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// * `StressNgConfig` - A new instance with the provided configuration.

    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// ```

    /// // Use `config` to run a stress-ng test
