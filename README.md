### **Are you fully utilizing your hardware infrastructure's potential?**

### **Are you overspending on GPUs or other hardware because you don't know exactly what your stack needs to perform?**

crayoneater-rs is a web-based and CLI toolkit engineered to enhance performance and reliability in enterprise hardware infrastructure. This toolkit is the culmination of my 8-year journey in enterprise SaaS in California and the Pacific Northwest, fused with skills honed during my 8 years as a US Marine.

### Ultra-Low Resource Utilization and Latency

Developed in Rust, crayoneater-rs takes advantage of WebAssembly (Wasm) to offer real-time performance and health monitoring with minimal overhead. This integration ensures resource-efficient, low-latency diagnostics directly in your browser.

### Addressing Core Enterprise Concerns

- **Performance versus Expenditure**: Ensures your investment in hardware is optimized for peak performance.
- **Power Consumption Optimization**: Identifies potential savings and environmental impacts through power efficiency enhancements.
- **Memory Configuration Integrity**: Validates reliability and stability in mixed memory configurations.
- **Storage Longevity**: Provides projections on storage device lifespan, aiding in timely upgrades.
- **NIC Performance Validation**: Ensures network interfaces perform to vendor specifications.
- **Thermal Efficiency**: Assesses and mitigates risks of thermal issues to maintain reliability.
