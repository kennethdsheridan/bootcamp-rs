## Why OneForAll?

### Embracing Open-Source Tools

OneForAll stands out in the backend engineering landscape for its unique integration of open-source tools. Recognizing
the absence of a comprehensive, all-in-one tool for backend engineers, OneForAll fills this gap effectively. It
seamlessly incorporates essential open-source tools such as:

**Redfish:** An industry-standard specification for managing and operating computing hardware.

**Flexible I/O Tester (FIO):** A versatile tool for I/O workload simulation, crucial for performance analysis.

**iperf3**: A widely-used network performance measurement tool, essential for bandwidth testing.

**stress-ng**: A tool for stress testing systems, vital for evaluating hardware robustness. Advantages of Building in
Rust

### Engineered in Rust, a decision driven by several key benefits:

**Performance:** Rust provides performance close to low-level languages like C, making it ideal for backend systems
where efficiency is paramount.

**Low Latency:** Rust's lack of a garbage collector translates to predictable, low-latency operation, crucial for
real-time applications.

**Memory Safety:** Rust's ownership model ensures memory safety, preventing common bugs and security vulnerabilities.

**Concurrency Support:** Rust's advanced concurrency features enable efficient and safe handling of parallel tasks, a
necessity in modern backend systems.

The additional engineering effort in developing with Rust is justified by these substantial advantages, especially in
terms of performance and latency improvements over garbage-collected and interpreted languages.

### Adapters Architecture:

OneForAll employs a modular adapters architecture, offering several long-term maintenance benefits:

**Scalability:** Adapters can be independently developed and scaled, allowing for more straightforward integration of
new features and tools.

**Maintainability:** This architecture simplifies updates and maintenance, as changes to one adapter do not necessarily
impact others.

**Flexibility:** Adapters enable OneForAll to be more adaptable to different environments and requirements, enhancing
its utility across various backend scenarios.

**Interoperability:** With a standardized interface, adapters facilitate better interoperability between different
systems and tools.
